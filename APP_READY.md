## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"No clothing detected"**
- Try a clearer image
- Make sure it's actually clothing
- Wait the full 5 seconds

**"No products found"**
- The Scrapeless API might be warming up
- Try a different search term
- Check backend terminal for errors

**Backend not responding**
- Make sure both terminals are running
- Check http://localhost:3001/api/health
